### 2IOA0 Group 2 Prototype
This prototype is a web based visual programming tool aimed at children in the K-12 age range with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The current version runs locally and is based on BlocklyDuino.

> See [BlockDuino v2](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino-v2) for the source and original README.

### Instructions
The current prototype version is not yet hosted and therefore runs locally.

To start the tool:
* Find `arduino_web_server.py` in the same folder as this README file and run it.
* Check the Command Prompt for confirmation. The window should say: `Blocklyduino can now be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
* Find the `2IOA0 Group 2 Prototype` shortcut in the same folder and run it.

The visual interface should now be open and the tool is ready to go!

To use the tool:
* Browse the categories in the toolbox on the left to find the code blocks
* Click and drag blocks to the workspace and snap them together to create a program
* When ready, hit the `Upload` button to send the code to the connected Arduino board

Additional features:
* The `Reset Arduino` button stops the current Arduino programming
* The `Clear Workspace` button clears all blocks from the workspace (after confirmation)
* The `Save Arduino Code` button allows the user to save (download) the Arduino code directly
* The `Save Project` and `Load Project` buttons allow the user to save and load the current block configuration and code
* The `Low Stimuli Mode` button activates low stimuli mode, a mode that mutes sounds and reduces colors to help prevent sensory overload
