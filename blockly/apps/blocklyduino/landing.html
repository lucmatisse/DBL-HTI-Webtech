      <h2>Introduction to the tool</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the 2IOA0 Group 2 visual programming tool! This tool is tailored to the needs of children aged 10-12 who are 
        on the autism spectrum. It aims to provide them an intuitive environment in which they can master the basics of programming
        by dragging, dropping, and snapping together visual blocks that represent programming concepts.
      </p>

      <p>For more information on the tool, see the <a href="../../../README.md">readme file.</a></p>

      <h2>Get started</h2>

      <p>
        Our tool runs completely in your web browser. You can try it straight away and use its basic features without installing
        anything. However, to use all features such as uploading directly to the Arduino, you will need to run a local web server. 
      </p>

      <p>You can download this server in the downloads section below.</p>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Downloads</h2>
      <p>
        To run the program, you need to have Python 2.7 installed on your computer. If you already have this, click the left option
        to download only the server. If you still need to install Python, click the right option!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are unsure if you have the correct version of Python installed or otherwise don't know how to proceed, ask an adult
        for help!
      </p>

      <h2>Install instructions</h2>

      <p>
        Your download should have started! Once it is done, find the downloaded zip folder in the location you saved it to. By default,
        this will be your "Downloads" folder. The file you're looking for is "2IOA0 Group 2 Web Server" or "2IOA0 Group 2 Web Server
        + Python" if you chose to download Python too.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Once you have found the file, right-click it to open the context menu. Find and click "Extract all..." as seen in the'
            image on the right. A new screen will open. Here, click the "Extract" button.
          </td>
          <td><img src="../../media/Extract ZIP file.png" alt="Extract All" style="width:100%"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="../../media/Extracted Files.png" alt="Extracted Files" style="width:100%"></td>
          <td>
            You should now see a screen similar to the one shown on the left. If you downloaded Python, double-click "python-2.7.18"
            to launch the installer. Follow the instructions in the install wizard to install Python 2.7.
            <br><br>
            Once Python is installed, or if this was already the case, you can launch the web server. Double-clicking the file
            "arduino_web_server" should open it. If not, right-click it to open the context menu, choose "Open with" and select
            python (make sure to use version 2.7). 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            The file should now open a command prompt. If everything went well, the window should read: "Blocklyduino can now
            be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8080/". 
            <br><br>
            The setup is now complete! Leave this window open in the background and see
            the next section.
          </td>
          <td><img src="../../media/Running Web Server.png" alt="Running Web Server" style="width:100%"></td>
        </tr>
