      <h2>Introduction to the tool</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the 2IOA0 Group 2 visual programming tool! This tool is tailored to the needs of children aged 10-12 who are 
        on the autism spectrum. It aims to provide them an intuitive environment in which they can master the basics of programming
        by dragging, dropping, and snapping together visual blocks that represent programming concepts.
      </p>

      <p>For more information on the tool, see the <a href="../../../README.md">readme file.</a></p>

      <p>To lauch the tool directly, <a href="index.html">click here!</a></p>

      <h2>Get started</h2>

      <p>
        Our tool runs completely in your web browser. You can try it straight away and use its basic features without installing
        anything. However, to use all features such as uploading directly to the Arduino, you will need to run a local web server. 
      </p>

      <p>You can download this server in the downloads section below.</p>

      <h2>Downloads</h2>
      <p>
        To run the program, you need to have Python 2.7 installed on your computer. If you already have this, click the left option
        to download only the server. If you still need to install Python, click the right option!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are unsure if you have the correct version of Python installed or don't know how to proceed, ask an adult for help!
      </p>

      <h2>Install instructions</h2>
      <p>Would be pretty cool if the site scrolls to this section after pressing a download button.</p>
      <p>The idea is that this part contains detailed instructions with pictures and such</p>

      <h2>Launch the tool</h2>
      <p>This section should have a button to launch the tool, might be nice to add a link to this button at the top to save time?</p>
