          This block is used to make something happen when a certain condistion is met.
          It can be extended by clicking the gear icon with else if and else statements.
          The else if statement can be used to check for another condition.
          the else statement can be used to perform an action if none of the previously stated conditions are met.

        <td>
          This block is used to put a for loop in the programme. 
          A for loop is used to loop through a part of the code a set number of times.
          The variable can be renamed and the start and end values can be added. 
          In the last gap, it can be added by how much the variable increases after every time the code in the loop has been executed.

          This block is used to put a loop in the programme.
          If while is chosen from the dropdown menu, the code will repeat until the condition is no longer met.
          If until is chosen, the code will repeat until the condition is met.
